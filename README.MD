<p> This is my moving eyes project, <br>
  The objective of this project is to make a eye following your cursor. <br>
  The eye follows the cursor no matter where it is. <br>
  You do not have to do anything expect go onto the website to run the program.<br>
  I am looking in the future of adding more eyes and making another feature of where you can make the eye go in the opposite direction of the mouse.<br>
